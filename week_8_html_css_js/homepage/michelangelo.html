      Michelangelo is the fun-loving, carefree member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
      He is known for his sense of humor, love of pizza, and his laid-back attitude.<br>
      Michelangelo is a skilled fighter, with a focus on agility and speed.
      He wields nunchaku, a pair of traditional Okinawan weapons that he uses to disarm and subdue his opponents.<br>
      Michelangelo is also a talented artist, often using his downtime to create works of art or play music.
      Despite his easygoing nature,
      Michelangelo is fiercely loyal to his family and friends, and will do whatever it takes to protect them.
